# pyKalah v1.2.0

Kalah, also called Kalaha or Mancala is a game in the mancala family invented in 
the United States by William Julius Champion, Jr. in 1940. This game is sometimes
also called "Kalahari", possibly by false etymology from the Kalahari desert in Namibia.

For most of its variations, Kalah is a solved game with a first-player win if both 
players play perfect games. The pie rule can be used to balance the first-player's advantage.
